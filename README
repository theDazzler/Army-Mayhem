Coding Conventions:
  Variable names are camel case(no underscores): exampleVariable 
  Class names start with capital letter: ExampleClass
  Function names are camel case(no underscores): exampleFunction

  I prefer brackets to start on a new line rather than on the same line as the function, class, or conditional statement
  ex.
  
  class Example
  {
    
  }



All game art is placeholder art for right now.
